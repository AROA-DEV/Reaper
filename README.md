Reaper is an open-source attack tool available on GitHub that allows users to automate the process of copying files from Documents, Images, and Desktop repositories. This batch script is designed to be run on Windows operating systems while the user is logged in, and it does not breach any of the security measures implemented by Windows.

The Reaper script is very user-friendly and easy to use. Once you download the script and move it to your USB (128GB minimum), you can run it by double-clicking on the file. It will prompt you to select the directories you want to copy from, which include Documents, Images, and Desktop repositories.

Reaper comes in two different versions. There is one for the Spanish version of Windows and another for the English version, ensuring that users can use the script regardless of their preferred language setting.

Reaper uses the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0), which means that it is free to use, modify, and distribute. However, the license does require that any modified versions of Reaper also be released under the same GPL-3.0 license.
